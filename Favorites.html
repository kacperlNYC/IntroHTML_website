                <p>One of my favorite things do is to binge-watch TV shows. I have Netflix, Disney Plus, Prime Video, and HBO Max. One of my favorite shows would have to be <span class="bold">The Boys</span> on prime video.</p>
                <p>I also love to play videogames with my friends. One of the games I've been playing a lot recently is Valorant Â©.</p>
                <p>One of my more productive hobbies would have to be programming. Making anything or challenging myself with code is always enjoyable. I hope to eventually find a job programming.</p>
